# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
- Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Merge your DataFrames.
- Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
- Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
  - The total number of rides for each city type.
  - The average fares for each city type.
  - The total number of drivers for each city type.
- Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
  - The number of rides for each city type.
  - The fares for each city type.
  - The number of drivers for each city type.
- Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
  - The percent of total fares.
  - The percent of total rides.
  - The percent of total drivers.

## Results
When we compare the average number of rides between each city type, we'll notice that 
- The average number of rides in the rural cities is about 3.5 and 2.5 times lower than urban and suburban cities, respectively.
- The average fare price is higher in rural cities followed by suburban cities.
- the average number of rides in the rural cities is about 4- and 3.5-times lower per city than the urban and suburban cities, respectively.
- There is one outlier in the urban ride count data. The urban city, West Angela, has the highest rider count. 
- From the combined box-and-whisker plots, we see that there are no outliers. However, the average fare for rides in the rural cities is about $11 and $5 more per ride than the urban and suburban cities, respectively. 
- The average number of drivers in rural cities is nine to four times less per city than in urban and suburban cities, respectively.
