# PyBer_Analysis

## PyBer Overview

A data analyst for a ride sharing company was asked to perform exploratory analysis and create visualizations of rideshare data from January to May of 2019 to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. The project required to import data from large csv files into Pandas dataframes, calculate summary statistics for total rides, total number of drivers and average fares for each city type while creating chart visualizations for the same. The challenge task aimed to use Pandas and Matplotlib and determine the following:
- The total number of rides for each city type.
- The total number of drivers for each city type.
- The sum of the fares for each city type.
- The average fare per ride for each city type.
- The average fare per driver for each city type.
- Create summary dataFrame and format numbers.
- Group the data in the summary dataFrame and create a pivot table with ride dates as index  
- Resample fare data into weekly bins on the date range: 2019-01-01 through 2019-04-28
- Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
